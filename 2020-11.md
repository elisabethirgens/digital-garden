## Fisher-Yates shuffle

JavaScript doesnâ€™t have a built-in method for shuffling arrays. Fisher-Yates is the recommended algorithm for an unbiased shuffle. Find a great explanation with tests in solution on: [javascript.info/task/shuffle](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle) And fantastic visualisations here: [bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)

`array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);` is a simple alternative to randomization, but only if probability is not important. Also note that performance is much better with Fisher-Yates, so that might still be the best approach either way.

## WebAssembly ðŸš€

The fourth language to run natively in browsers together with HTML, CSS and JS. WebAssembly is a compilation target for other source programming languages â€” web applications can be written in Rust, C, C++ etc and then run in WebAssembly. Useful resources:

## Validation in `<input type="email">`

**Basic validation** is implemented by browsers as a regex pattern to match a standard format for email addresses. **Pattern validation** can be used in addition to filter further, by specifying a regex in the pattern attribute. MDN on these [two levels of content validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email#Validation) for email inputs. ðŸš¨ _Client-side validation is not a substitute for validating on the server._

## Constraint Validation API

Browsers can natively validate for attributes like `minlength` or `maxlength` and so on, but can also do things like setting a custom message with the `setCustomValidity()` method. More to study:
