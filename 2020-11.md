## Fisher-Yates shuffle

JavaScript doesnâ€™t have a built-in method for shuffling arrays. Fisher-Yates is the recommended algorithm for an unbiased shuffle. Find a great explanation with tests in solution on: [javascript.info/task/shuffle](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle) And fantastic visualisations here: [bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)

`array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);` is a simple alternative to randomization, but only if probability is not important. Also note that performance is much better with Fisher-Yates, so that might still be the best approach either way.
