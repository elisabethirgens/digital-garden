## autocomplete 🚫

Attribute for `<form>` or specific inputs to stop the browser from saving user input. Browser will not cache data in the session history, or show suggestions in the input. **MDN web security:** [turn off form autocompletion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#The_autocomplete_attribute_and_login_fields)

## submit 🧨

Event fires on the `<form>` element. Happens when a user presses enter, clicks `<button>` or `<input type="submit">` – but does not fire on any submit button. [HTMLFormElement: submit event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event)

## Web Storage API 🗄

Cookies used to be the main way to store information on the browser, but HTML5 introduced a storage object with `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`. Both share the same methods and properties.

## CustomEvent ⚡️

Add custom data to an event object by using [`CustomEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent). Not fired by the browser itself? Then called "synthetic events". MDN: [Creating and triggering events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events)
