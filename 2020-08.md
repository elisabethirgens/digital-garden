## Trailing commas

Aha! Not just "a formatting rule in Prettier", but part of the language. Some are legal, others will throw a syntax error. JS has always allowed trailing commas in array literals, and ES5 added them to object literals. Not allowed in JSON. **MDN JavaScript reference:** [Trailing commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas)

## ESLint and Prettier integration

Okay! First understand the difference between formatting rules and code-quality rules, then pick a strategy for how to use the tools. Best explanations I found: [Prettier vs. Linters](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html) and [Integrating with Linters](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html). I don't get why many prefer setting up additional dependencies, seems fine to use just the two together on their own, as long as I don't load up ESLint with stylistic rules that conflict with Prettier.
