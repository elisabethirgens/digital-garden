## Trailing commas

Aha! Not just "a formatting rule in Prettier", but part of the language. Some are legal, others will throw a syntax error. JS has always allowed trailing commas in array literals, and ES5 added them to object literals. Not allowed in JSON. **MDN JavaScript reference:** [Trailing commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas)

## ESLint and Prettier integration

Okay! First understand the difference between formatting rules and code-quality rules, then pick a strategy for how to use the tools. Best explanations I found: [Prettier vs. Linters](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html) and [Integrating with Linters](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html). I don't get why many prefer setting up additional dependencies, seems fine to use just the two together on their own, as long as I don't load up ESLint with stylistic rules that conflict with Prettier.

## git config user.email

Setting up Git requires a user `name` and `email` for identity and is baked into commits. In addition to the global `.gitconfig` on my machine â€“ there is a local `my-project/.git/config` where I can use a different email addresse. GitHub needs a verified email to associate commits with an account. It's possible to keep that email address private, and also to [block command line pushes that expose that email](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address).

## Destructuring

ES6 expression to create multiple variables. **Array destructuring** with basic variable assignment, default values and more nifty uses. **Object destructuring** to unpack values nested in an object, can also be renamed and get default values.
