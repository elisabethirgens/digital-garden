# Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

Inspired by [Maggie Appleton's tweet](https://twitter.com/mappletons/status/1279798483218767877) illustrating chaos streams vs cultivated performance â€“ and the learning in public between â€“ I want to try having a place to put things.

## Future feature ideas ðŸ’¡

Iâ€™m starting to develop vague ideas around structuring and creating functionality in this garden of mine. The plan was to _start_ with basic `.md` files and incrementally move on to something else.

* tags for entries, so I can get a list of every entry tagged `js` or `graphql`. Why? To visualize progress, when did I first plant an entry about `d3` and how much have I learnt since then.
* bookmarks in entries, so I get generate a list of these URLs. Why? To remind myself of things that peaked my interest and that I may want to revisit for more active study later
