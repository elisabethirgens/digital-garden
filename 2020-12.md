## Web IDL

An [interface description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) is a specification to describe an API. The [Web IDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) is a format for APIs intended to be implemented in web browsers, described by Wikipedia as: “A mapping of how interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to language constructs within an ECMAScript execution environment.”

## IDL attributes

HTML attributes have two faces, like pairs that correspond most of the time but not necessarily. The content attribute is set from the content (HTML) and the IDL attribute is the JavaScript property, what you can read or set using JS.

> The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you set it.
