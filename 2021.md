## translate attribute ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

It is always fascinating to thinking about how people read content in completely different ways than the we, the people creating those web pages, want to think about. Like automatic translation! ðŸ˜± Not only will German text take up significantly more space, or Chinese will spend way fewer characters but possibly require a larger font size â€” but some words that _shouldnâ€™t_ be translated, may be distorted anyway. Like names! Adding the attribute `translate="no"` indicates that this specific element should not be translated.
