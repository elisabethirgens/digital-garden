## autocomplete 🚫

Attribute for `<form>` or specific inputs to stop the browser from saving user input. Browser will not cache data in the session history, or show suggestions in the input. **MDN web security:** [turn off form autocompletion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#The_autocomplete_attribute_and_login_fields)

## submit 🧨

Event fires on the `<form>` element. Happens when a user presses enter, clicks `<button>` or `<input type="submit">` – but does not fire on any submit button. [HTMLFormElement: submit event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event)

## Web Storage API 🗄

Cookies used to be the main way to store information on the browser, but HTML5 introduced a storage object with `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`. Both share the same methods and properties. [Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)

## CustomEvent ⚡️

Add custom data to an event object by using [`CustomEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent). Not fired by the browser itself? Then called "synthetic events". MDN: [Creating and triggering events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events)

## Trailing commas

Aha! Not just "a formatting rule in Prettier", but part of the language. Some are legal, others will throw a syntax error. JS has always allowed trailing commas in array literals, and ES5 added them to object literals. Not allowed in JSON. **MDN JavaScript reference:** [Trailing commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas)

## ESLint and Prettier integration

Okay! First understand the difference between formatting rules and code-quality rules, then pick a strategy for how to use the tools. Best explanations I found: [Prettier vs. Linters](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html) and [Integrating with Linters](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html). I don't get why many prefer setting up additional dependencies, seems fine to use just the two together on their own, as long as I don't load up ESLint with stylistic rules that conflict with Prettier.

## git config user.email

Setting up Git requires a user `name` and `email` for identity and is baked into commits. In addition to the global `.gitconfig` on my machine – there is a local `my-project/.git/config` where I can use a different email addresse. GitHub needs a verified email to associate commits with an account. It's possible to keep that email address private, and also to [block command line pushes that expose that email](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address).

## Destructuring

ES6 expression to create multiple variables. **Array destructuring** with basic variable assignment, default values and more nifty uses. **Object destructuring** to unpack values nested in an object, can also be renamed and get default values. [MDN: Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

## JSON stringify & parse

JSON is a data-interchange **format**, but in the JavaScript language there is a **standard built-in JSON object** that has two static methods: `JSON.stringify()` transforms a JS object into a JSON string. `JSON.parse()` transforms a JSON string into a JS object.

## Closures

Functions in JS create closures. When I declare variables and functions _inside_ another function, this outer function and the lexical environment within it, becomes the closure.
More on **practical closures** and **emulating private methods** +++ in [this MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).

## Fiber

The core algorithm in React. “This new algorithm improves responsiveness and perceived performance for complex pages. But to make that happen, the architecture had to be reconsidered from the ground up.” — [

## Fisher-Yates shuffle

JavaScript doesn’t have a built-in method for shuffling arrays. Fisher-Yates is the recommended algorithm for an unbiased shuffle. Find a great explanation with tests in solution on: [javascript.info/task/shuffle](https://javascript.info/task/shuffle) And fantastic visualisations here: [bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)

`array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);` is a simple alternative to randomization, but only if probability is not important. Also note that performance is much better with Fisher-Yates, so that might still be the best approach either way.

## WebAssembly 🚀

The fourth language to run natively in browsers together with HTML, CSS and JS. WebAssembly is a compilation target for other source programming languages — web applications can be written in Rust, C, C++ etc and then run in WebAssembly. Useful resources:

- JSConf EU talk by Lin Clark: [A Cartoon Intro to WebAssembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HktWin_LPf4)
- MDN docs on [WebAssembly Concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts)
- [webassembly.org/docs/use-cases](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/)

## Validation in `<input type="email">`

**Basic validation** is implemented by browsers as a regex pattern to match a standard format for email addresses. **Pattern validation** can be used in addition to filter further, by specifying a regex in the pattern attribute. MDN on these [two levels of content validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email#Validation) for email inputs. 🚨 _Client-side validation is not a substitute for validating on the server._

## Constraint Validation API

Browsers can natively validate for attributes like `minlength` or `maxlength` and so on, but can also do things like setting a custom message with the `setCustomValidity()` method. More to study:

- [developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation)
- [css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-2-constraint-validation-api-javascript/](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-2-constraint-validation-api-javascript/)

## `strftime`

Method to format dates in many different languages, originally from C and a shorthand for “string format time”. JavaScript doesn’t have native date formatting, but libraries or templating languages get the job done. When figuring out which letters to use, it helps to know `strftime` is the search phrase to find overviews of the syntax. My favorites for Norwegian style date formats:

- `%A %e %B %Y` **Monday 5 October 2020**
- `%d.%m.%y` **05.10.20**

## Web IDL

An [interface description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) is a specification to describe an API. The [Web IDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) is a format for APIs intended to be implemented in web browsers, described by Wikipedia as: “A mapping of how interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to language constructs within an ECMAScript execution environment.”

## IDL attributes

HTML attributes have two faces, like pairs that correspond most of the time but not necessarily. The content attribute is set from the content (HTML) and the IDL attribute is the JavaScript property, what you can read or set using JS.

> The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you set it.

More on [content attributes vs IDL attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes#Content_versus_IDL_attributes)
